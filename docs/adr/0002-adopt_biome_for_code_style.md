# ADR 0002: Replace ESLint and Prettier with Biome
- Date: 2025-08-18
- Biome unifies formatting and linting in one tool.
- Single config reduces dependency overhead.
- Alternatives (ESLint+Prettier) duplicated responsibilities.
- Biome's speed improves developer feedback loop.
- Decision sets Biome as default code style guardian.
- Consistency enforced across apps and packages.
- Outcome: adopt Biome for linting, formatting, and imports.
- Status: accepted.
