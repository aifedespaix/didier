# ADR 0009: Standardize Testing with Vitest and Playwright
- Date: 2025-08-19
- Vitest offers fast TypeScript-aware unit tests.
- Playwright covers end-to-end browser scenarios.
- Mock-friendly APIs aid deterministic simulations.
- Alternatives (Jest, Cypress) added heavier runtimes.
- Decision unifies test configs across packages and apps.
- Coverage thresholds enforce code quality.
- Outcome: reliable automated tests from unit to E2E.
- Status: accepted.
