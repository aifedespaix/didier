# ADR 0006: Scaffold Asset Pipeline Command-Line Tools
- Date: 2025-08-19
- Centralized CLI handles model and audio processing.
- Placeholders reserve targets for gltfpack, basisu, ffmpeg.
- Reduces manual errors and ensures deterministic outputs.
- Alternatives (manual scripts) risked inconsistency.
- Decision standardizes asset optimization workflows.
- Future extensions can plug into shared pipeline.
- Outcome: prepared tooling for automated asset builds.
- Status: accepted.
